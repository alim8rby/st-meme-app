Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This is my very first Streamlit app â€” built completely from scratch. It may be small,
But it carries all the DNA of larger AI projects Iâ€™ll be working on in the future.
Hereâ€™s the process I followed (and the same one you can use too):

- Start with a fresh Git repo.
- Add new functionality step by step.
- Build out the user interface with Streamlit.
- Commit as I go, so I can always roll back if needed.
- Maintain a clean environment with a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

This app experiments with Stable Diffusion + LoRA weights inside a simple Streamlit interface â€” but more importantly,
Itâ€™s a practical example of how applied AI projects come to life.

Why Iâ€™m Sharing This?
Iâ€™m not just showing code. Iâ€™m showing the workflow â€” how to go from idea to commit to working demo.
If youâ€™re starting your own AI projects, these same steps will guide you.

In Association With:
This project was developed in association with WorldQuantâ€™s Applied AI Lab, 
where Iâ€™m exploring how generative AI can be both powerful and practical.
